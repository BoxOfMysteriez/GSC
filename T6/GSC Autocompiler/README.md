# GSC Autocompiler

The auto compiler gsc is nothing but a simple powershell script that allows you to compile a mod for Black ops II (Plutonium and Redacted).
The script uses three directories:
1. 'src': Folder where is contained the source code to compile
2. 'bin': Folder where the compiled script is placed
3. 'compiler': Folder where the compiler for the gsc scripts is kept


### The Compiler folder
The gsc compiler is the compiler provided by the Plutonium team. In fact, it will not be provided by default due to security.
